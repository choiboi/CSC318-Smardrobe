This is a mobile application where it will help users decide what to wear for the day.

Contributing to this Project

If this is the first using please look into this wiki page: [Getting Setup](https://github.com/choiboi/CSC318-Smardrobe/wiki/Getting-Setup). These are instruction on getting you guys setup to use Github and Android Development.

In this project we will not branching out and instead use the default `master` branch. Since, we are only using the `master` branch this will be like SVN where we will have conflicts if one does not update their local branch before committing. Therefore, I suggest people to notify every team members via Facebook group page or any other form of communication that you made changes and it has been pushed into the repository. 

To clone the repository use this command in the directory where you want the folder to be located:

    $ git clone git@github.com:choiboi/CSC318-Smardrobe.git

To commit into the repository:

    # Adding files. Only do this step if Git does not have files on record.
    $ git add <list of files>
    
    # Commit with message.
    $ git commit -m "<commit message>" <files>
    
    # Pushing into repository.
    $ git push origin master
    
To update local repository:

    $ git pull origin master
    
Deleting files in the repository:

    $ git rm [-r | recursively remove files in the directory] <file or directory>
    
    $ git commit -m "<commit message>" <removed files>
    
    $ git push origin master
